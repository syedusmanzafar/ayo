Botta-Bing in a nutshell is Text to Speech AI Information Tool. It is driven by natural language AI technology processing Voice to Text with information integrations and corrections from popular API's including: **ChatGPT, OpenWeatherMaps.org, NewsData.io, Google Cloud**.

Once installed, you can simply speak to the **Botta-Bing** app and it will answer you back in its own conversational style. This project was created to integrate with the **"Micro Mini Monster"** and the **"Megha Monster"** line of SpyBots and Computer Enabled Rovers. However it will work as a standalone **Text to Speech AI Information Tool.**

## More Information
*To Start Your Vagrant Instance Please use the command line. If you just start the box the mapped "/vagrant" folder will not be available.* 
***cd the downloaded "Botta-Bing" Folder***
- To Start your "Botta-Bing" Vagrant instance **RUN:** vagrant up
- To Restart your "Botta-Bing" Vagrant instance **RUN:** vagrant reload

## Troubleshooting
- My Bot is talking too slow - This is a system resource problem. If you are running VirtualBox and Vagrant add memory or additional cpus. 
- My Bot is talking too fast - This is a system resource problem. If you are running VirtualBox and Vagrant reduce memory or additional cpus. 
- My Bot is talking too low - Raise the volume on your computer
- My Bot can't hear me - Test your microphone. An amplified Microphone with an on\off switch works best.
- Do I have to say "Computer" all the time? Yes and No. The listener in Botta-Bing wakes up when it hears sound so you can say something else like. "Machine" or "Moca," or "Bot" or "Peter" etc. Practice with the name of your choosing.
- I can't get weather or news or it won't transcribe my voice info - There is a problem with your api keys. Check to see if they are entered correctly in the "params" file.  If there is a transcription error re-run "gcloud init" from the command line
